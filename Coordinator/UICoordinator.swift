	///	Some examples:
	///	* instantiate and assign `viewControllers` for UINavigationController or UITabBarController
	///	* assign itself (Coordinator) as delegate for the shown UIViewController(s)
	///	* setup closure entry/exit points
	///	etc.

	///
	///	Note: if you override this method, you must call `super` and pass the `completion` closure.
